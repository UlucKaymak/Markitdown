# Mark it down

**mark it down** is another minimal markdown reader and editor designed to keep you away from clutter, allowing you to focus solely on your text and thoughts.

**Personal Note:** I searched for a good markdown editors, they want  much effort to use. This is the best for my use case. (Note taking, blogging, reading and writing GDDs and Reports.)
